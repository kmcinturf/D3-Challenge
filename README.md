# D3-Challenge
D3_data_journalism

In this homework I have to plot smoking vs age, and income vs age.

## Set Up

I acceptected a task to make a visualization for a major metro paper. 
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)
This homework utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** These are the main files to run the analysis.




## Project Report

My conclusion is the following:
	1: It seems that as you get older, you have a trend to smoke a bit more if you smoke
	2: It seems as that age is as you get older you tend to be have slighlty less income. Although this seems ot be due to some possible outliars. 

### **Important things to note:**
This data set is interactive
